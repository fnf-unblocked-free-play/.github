## Pro Tips – From Someone Who’s Conquered Every Hard Mod

After grinding through *Tricky* and *Whitty* mods on Hard mode, I’ve picked up a few tips that can help both newcomers and rhythm veterans:

* **Use your ears first, eyes second**: Anticipating notes by beat is more reliable than just watching the arrows.
* **Combo > Perfection**: Staying consistent matters more than hitting every note perfectly.
* **Start with Medium difficulty**: It’s the perfect balance to build up your skills.
* **Try fan-made mods**: Some of the best challenges come from the community.
* **Lower background volume**: If you’re struggling, reduce background noise to focus on note cues.

## What Makes FNF So Special?

* **Incredible music**: A blend of jazz, lo-fi, synth, and more — all composed by **Kawai Sprite**.
* **Stylish retro visuals**: Nostalgic '90s arcade vibes with a fresh twist.
* **Limitless expansion**: As an open-source game, FNF is packed with fan-made mods, songs, and characters.
